# Search the web

This extension allows you to open the default browser and search the selected text using a set of predefined URLs.

If no text is selected the word at cursor position will be searched. Useful if you want to use it for language reference, just as you can do in most IDEs to get help on the current word when you hit F1.

## Features

You can set an array of URL patterns and define the languages they will be available for.

A default action can be set for any language.

The `"Search the web"` command opens the default browser with the default action for the current document language.

The `"Search the web using..."` command displays a list of URLs that match the current document language.

These two options show in the context menu after text selection.

Default configuration uses some of the original URLs and a few more:
- Google Search
- Google Search including the language name
- DuckDuckGo Search
- DuckDuckGo Search including the language name
- PHP Help
- Mozilla Developer


## Extension Settings

You can specify any web sites you want to use with the extension in the `search-the-web.actionList` configuration.

An action is defined by:
- `label`: the text that will be shown in the selection list.
- `url`: the URL template. It can contain `%SELECTION%` and `%LANG%` keywords.
  - `%SELECTION%` will be replaced by selected text.
  - `%LANG%` will be replaced by current file language (html, javascript, xml...)
- `languages`: array of languages that the URL can be used with
  - `*` means it will be available for any language.
- `defaultFor`: optional property with an array of languages that this URL will be the default one. Here you can set the default action for a language.

> If more than one action is available for the current language, the first one where `defaultFor` includes the language will be used.
>
> If there is no default action defined for a language the first action from the list of all available actions will be chosen.
